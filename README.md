# ADS1299 Bridge for the ESP32

This Arduino library allows users to connect the TI ADS1299 to the Espressif ESP32.

You'll need to install the ESP32 library from Espressif's repository first. Instructions on getting started can be found on Adafruit's website:
https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-huzzah32-esp32-feather/using-with-arduino-ide

Once installed, download this ADS1299 repository as a zip download and add as a zip library through the Arduino IDE. Instructions on manually adding an Arduino library can be found here:
https://www.arduino.cc/en/guide/libraries

From there, you should be able to run the library through one of the included demo sketches.
